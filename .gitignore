# Backend Python

### Why is this better?
*   **Centralized:** All your ignore rules are in one place.
*   **Clearer Paths:** Using `/frontend/node_modules` explicitly ignores the `node_modules` folder only within the `frontend` directory.
*   **Correct Scoping:** The Python rules (`__pycache__`) are now at the root level, so they will correctly apply to the `backend/python` directory.

Once you have this new, single `.gitignore` file in place, you are ready to start a clean Git repository and push it to GitHub without any secrets.
